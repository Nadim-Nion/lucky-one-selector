# Select Toys For Your Children (Lucky One Selector)

## React Single Page Application - SPA (Assignment 8)

---
### React Shopping Cart SPA

Welcome to the React Shopping Cart Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and enhanced with custom CSS for styling.

### Key Features:

1. **Responsive Design:** This SPA is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless shopping experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

2. **Add to Cart:** Users can easily add their favorite products to the "Selected Toys" component by clicking the 'Add to Cart' button.

3. **Cart Limit:** To keep things manageable, the cart allows users to add a maximum of 4 items. If a user attempts to exceed this limit, they will receive an alert message.

4. **Random Product Selection:** For a touch of surprise, users can choose a random product from the available selection. However, if the cart is empty and a user tries to select an item, they will receive an alert.

5. **Prevent Duplicate Products:** We've made sure that users cannot add the same product to the cart more than once. If they try to do so, they will be alerted.

6. **Cart Reset:** To start fresh or make a new selection, users can reset the cart by clicking the 'Choose again' button.

This React SPA offers a user-friendly and responsive shopping experience with features that make shopping for toys both fun and convenient. Explore the world of toys with ease! ðŸ›’ðŸŽ‰

Feel free to check out the code, contribute, or use this project as a basis for your own e-commerce applications. Happy shopping!

**Note:** This project uses React and plain CSS for styling, so it's a great starting point for those looking to learn or work with these technologies.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
